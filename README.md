# kotlin-read-webhooks
Read Webhooks using Kotlin

* We're using [Qoddi](https://qoddi.com/) for the deployment
* Clone this repo and use it to upload it on Koyeb
* We're going to need some Enviroment Variables: **V3_TOKEN**, **CALENDAR_ID**, **GRANT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET** (Which should remain empty until we create a webhook and get a webhook secret).
* Once deployed, open the URL on your browser, create an event, and the webhook will be triggered and added to the application.
